# simple-dapp
I put this together following the LearnWeb3 
["Create An Ethereum Dapp with Etherjs" tutorial](https://www.learnweb3.io/tracks/freshman)

Using Metamask, Remix IDE, and Etherejs we:
1. Create a very simple Ethereum smart contract on the RemixIDE
2. Compile and deploy on the Ropsten testnet
3. Put together a minimal ui to allow us to interact with our deployed contract
